# nyt-autorenew

The Toronto Public Library gives free New York Times access to its users. Each access pass expires in 72 hours, but the number of available renewals is not restricted. This script can be set up as a cron job to run every 72 hours, thus enabling unlimited access with no downtime. Requires TPL card and a Gmail account.
